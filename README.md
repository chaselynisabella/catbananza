# catbananza

Game Description:
You are a mouse trying to get to the golden cheese. The mouse will navigate a maze-like
scenario, collecting cheese, that serves as ammo, to fend off cat attackers. You have three lives
and each time you collide with a cat, one life is lost. As you navigate, the screen constantly
moves to the right and you must also avoid barriers.
Win: You win when you find the golden cheese
Lose: You lose if you lag behind the moving screen or if three cats catch you.
Controls:
[UP][LEFT][RIGHT][DOWN]: used to navigate the mouse
[A]: shoot cheese at the cats
[START]: engages the pause screen, can either continue or restart
[B]: activates the cheat code - the cheat allows the mouse to become invincible so cats cannot
reduce the number of lives
